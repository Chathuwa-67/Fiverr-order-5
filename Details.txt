'Fields’ began as a collaborative effort with Indian three time Grammy winner Ricky Kej, originally intended for a UN environmental initiative, and is featuring exceptional musicians like Cindy Blackmon-Santana and Victor Wooten. Over time, it evolved into a solo project, reflecting both the collaborative spirit and my personal artistic vision. ‘Fields’ presents a unique blend of influences, showcasing intricate rhythms and emotive melodies that resonate deeply with listeners. It has already won Global Award Medal as well as notable nomination for Hollywood Independent Music Awards. This track stands out not only for its musical excellence but also for its journey from a collaborative piece to a showcase of individual creativity.

‘RMJ’ is a groundbreaking project that merges the sounds of Ragas, Makams, and Jazz into a fresh and innovative musical experience. The album features exotic piano solos that, despite their initial rough edges, push the envelope and add a unique, explorative quality to the worldly sound. These eccentric elements, once refined in the mixing process, enhance the album’s distinctive character. By blending traditional jazz with contemporary influences, ‘RMJ’ offers the listener with a vibrant soundscape.

Israeli Anthem Re-Vista - FYC Best Instrumental Arrangement
Produced by Kobi Arad
Co-Produced by Charlie Sabach & Charu Suri
Remixed by Lonnie Park
Ft. Charlie Sabach (Oud)

‘Israeli Anthem’ is a thought-provoking piece that deconstructs the traditional anthem through innovative musical techniques such as fugatos and counterpoint imitations. This disintegration of the theme reflects the current state of the nation, highlighting the erosion of spirit and morale in Israel following the October 7th attack and ongoing conflicts. The composition serves as a musical commentary on the struggles faced by displaced communities and the impact on national identity. By reinterpreting the anthem, ‘Israeli Hymn’ captures the complexity of the nation’s emotional and moral landscape during these challenging times.
